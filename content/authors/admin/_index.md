I am a Reader of statistical ecology in the Center for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling (CREEM) at the University of St Andrews. My research focuses on understanding the spatial process that give rise to spatio-temporal ecological dynamics. I do this by developing biologically realistic statistical models and applying them to data collected on individuals, populations and communities. Ultimately, I'm motivated solving real management and conservation problems using ecological theory and quantitative tools.
